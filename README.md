# Sudoku-In-JFrame-and-CMD

This project is a Java-based Sudoku game that includes both a graphical user interface (GUI) version using `JFrame` and a command-line interface (CLI) version. The game generates Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm, ensuring that each puzzle has a unique solution. 

The GUI version allows users to play Sudoku interactively by filling in the grid with numbers, while the CLI version offers a more straightforward text-based gameplay experience. Both versions validate user input and check if the puzzle has been correctly solved, providing an engaging and educational way to practice logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
